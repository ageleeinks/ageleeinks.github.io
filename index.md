Welcome to my webpage and please enjoy your stay!





My work dives into unknown realms of extraordinary and surreal. Expression is by ink, a medium of permanent stillness. With each stroke, its essence glides pass surfaces, binding to our physical world. “In the moment” creations and transient energies trickle into the atmosphere and the Universe.

For these random ink musings – I’ve named them Kalliglipfs as my way of such expression.

Kalliglipfs are spontaneous intricate designs in a calligraphy style that I have been drawing for the last decade. The Universe and its elements, guiding the ink and my pen, manifest itself to all beings.

In sharing with the world, you’ll see things in each unique design. Perhaps, it’s the energy, some resonance, an impression, or even a connection of some sort. Maybe it’s the tangled strokes or wavy lines of these intricate patterns that reaches out to you in. Whatever it is, it is something between you and these unusual motifs.

So, let yourself venture with these “transitory/momentary” ink forms.
