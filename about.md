   Age Lee is a Toronto-based artist, whose journey spanned from life sciences to communicative studies to the visual arts, as well as pondering many things of the human condition such as our origins, behavior, and interaction with each other in the world we live in, and the Universe.   

   Ever since stumbling into the timeless craft of calligraphy, Age has plunged deeper into unexplored dimensions of ink and its magic, which flows with boundless spirit and energy.
